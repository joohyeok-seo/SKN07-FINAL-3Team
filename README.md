## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

**PUDAC (Personalized User Dietary Assistant Chatbot)** is an AI-powered chatbot designed to recommend personalized meals by considering individual health goals, dietary preferences, and allergies.  
The system integrates LLM-powered retrieval (RAG), a structured food database, and collaborative filtering algorithms to generate subscription-ready meal recommendations.

## ðŸ”§ System Architecture
User â†’ Frontend (Streamlit/Chainlit)
â†’ Backend (FastAPI)
â†’ ChromaDB document search
â†’ OpenAI Embedding API â†’ FAISS vector DB
â†’ OpenAI GPT API (fine-tuned model)

- **Frontend**: Chat-based UI for real-time interaction  
- **Backend**: Routes inputs and orchestrates recommendation logic  
- **Retriever**: FAISS + LangChain for semantic document search  
- **Response**: Generated by fine-tuned GPT model using context-aware retrieval

## ðŸ“‚ Data Sources & Structure

- **Data Sources**:
  - Korea Ministry of Food and Drug Safety
  - Naver Encyclopedia (food info)
  - Public allergen documents

- **Database Structure**:
  - User profile info (age, gender, goal, allergies)
  - Nutritional food database (name, category, calories, protein, etc.)
  - Conversation logs for personalization

## ðŸ¤– AI & Recommendation Pipeline

### 1. RAG-Based LLM Response
- Embedding: OpenAI Embedding API  
- Retrieval: FAISS + LangChain Retriever  
- Generation: OpenAI GPT with domain fine-tuning  
- Backend: FastAPI to handle flow

### 2. Collaborative Filtering (CF)
- **User-based CF**: Suggests meals liked by users with similar profiles  
- **Item-based CF**: Recommends meals similar to previously liked dishes  
- Hybridized with GPT for cold-start cases and enhanced personalization

## ðŸ“ˆ Performance Comparison (Before & After Fine-Tuning)

| Scenario | Initial GPT Response | Fine-Tuned GPT Response |
|---------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| "I'm on a diet. Recommend lunch." | "You can eat salad or fruits." | "Grilled chicken (119kcal, 24.4g protein), sea snail salad (122kcal), and stir-fried squid (123kcal) are recommended. All are high-protein, low-fat options." |

## ðŸ‘¤ My Role

Initially started as a 4-person team project.  
Due to one dropout and two early hires, I completed the final stages **entirely on my own**.

My contributions included:

- Data collection and preprocessing  
- Database schema design and setup  
- Backend development using FastAPI  
- Implementing RAG structure with FAISS + LangChain  
- Collaborative filtering algorithm development  
- GPT API integration and prompt design  
- Chatbot frontend development  
- Final tech presentation and documentation
